# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to determine two things: The number of retiring employees by their title and to identify any employees who would be eligible for a mentorship program. 

## Results
- From the "Unique_titles" table, we found that there were 90,398 employees that could potentially retire.

- The title with the largest number of potential retirees is the "Senior Engineer" title, with roughly 22,000 employees.

- From the "Mentorship_eligibilty" table, we found that there are 1,940 people that would be eligible to become a mentor.

-From the "Mentorship_eligibilty" table, the window for mentorship consideration is only between January 1965 and December 1965, which is considerably small compared to the amount of total employees. 

## Summary
As the "silver tsunami" begins to make its impact, there's a disproportional number of employees that could retire than the number of people that would potentially serve as mentors. More than 90,000 employees could retire, and while that is plenty of retirement-ready employees, most of them are not qualified to become mentors. 

-One approach is to widen the age range that qualifies potential mentors. Just because there are 1,940 potential mentors doesn't mean that they all want to participate. Currently, the eligibility table filters the birth date between January 1965 and December 1965. If the dates widen to include an additional year, the number of potential mentors increases to almost 25,000 potential mentors.

If the dates widen to include an additional two years, the number of potential mentors increases to about 47,000 potential mentors.
